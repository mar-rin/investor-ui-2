The Battle of Five Armies had been averted, thanks to the diplomacy and courage of Bilbo Baggins. Thorin Oakenshield, finally freed from the grip of dragon sickness, had realized the value of friendship and honor, and had agreed to share the wealth of the mountain with the Men, Elves, and Dwarves alike. But one challenge remained - the menacing presence of Smaug, the Dragon King. Though no longer the marauding force he once was, Smaug refused to abandon the treasures he had amassed within the mountain. Bilbo, for all his bravery, could not find the words to convince Smaug to leave peacefully."
